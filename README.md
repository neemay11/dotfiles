# Dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles that I use when programming.

Dotfiles are organized by different directories pertaining to the application they are configuring.
Each directory has an install.sh script that will symlink the files within them to their respective locations.
In the root directory the `install.sh` script will run the install scripts for each subdirectory.
